                            <h3 class="mb-4"> Problem Statement</h3>
                            <p>The flower industry faces challenges in maintaining the freshness and quality of flowers
                                throughout the supply chain,
                                from sourcing to final sale. Customers frequently encounter issues like limited variety,
                                short flower shelf-life, and
                                inconsistency in quality. Additionally, there is a need for convenient and reliable
                                access to flowers, as consumers are
                                increasingly looking for flexible purchasing options. Botanical Bliss seeks to address
                                these issues by establishing a
                                system that ensures freshness, consistency, and availability, thereby enhancing the
                                customer experience and reducing
                                waste.</p>
